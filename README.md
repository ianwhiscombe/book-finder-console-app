> A small CRUD based app that runs in the console designed to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript classes, constructors and methods.
> This app holds a library of your books, showing the title, author, genre, location in your house and your five star rating. It allows you to:

> Create a new book and and it to your library.
> Read/search for an existing book.
> Update and amend the location and rating of a book.
> Delete a book from your library.

## Usage

```sh
Open your browser console to see the app in action. 
```
